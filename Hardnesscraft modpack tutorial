This is a detailed walkthrough/tutorial of Hardnesscraft, below is the tutorial.
I am going to make it short as possible.
You don't have to read the tutorial, but for better understanding of the modpack, you could read this, or you are more welcome to edit the Hardness craft wiki.

TUTORIAL STARTS
This is the starter tutorial of Hardnesscraft.
When you first login into the world, you wanna find a lot of gravels, then, get some flints from those gravel, as much as possible!
After you have some flints, you want to find some hard surfaces such as stone, iron ore/block, cobblestone, etc. Then right click on the hard surface whilst holding flint, it will crash into flint piece, you can use them to craft basic tools, you can find more information in JEI, just search word "flint", then, click on flint knife, that is what you will need in the short future.
